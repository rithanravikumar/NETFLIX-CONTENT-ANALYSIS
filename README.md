Netflix has revolutionized the way people consume entertainment, from its early days as a DVD rental service to its current status as a streaming giant. Here's a more detailed look at Netflix:

## History and Growth:

Founded: Netflix was founded in 1997 by Reed Hastings and Marc Randolph in Los Gatos, California. Initially, it was a DVD rental-by-mail service, a competitor to traditional video rental stores like Blockbuster.
Streaming Transition: In 2007, Netflix shifted focus to online streaming, allowing subscribers to watch movies and TV shows directly over the internet. This move marked a major turning point, as it changed the entertainment industry.
Original Content: Netflix began producing its own original content in 2013, starting with the hit show House of Cards. This decision further differentiated Netflix from its competitors, as it became known for investing heavily in original programming.

Localization of Content: Netflix has embraced global production by investing in and producing regional content, such as Money Heist (Spain), Sacred Games (India), and Dark (Germany). This focus on local content has expanded its subscriber base and strengthened its position internationally.

## Business Model:

Subscription Service: Netflix operates on a subscription-based model, offering multiple pricing tiers depending on factors like video quality (HD, Ultra HD) and the number of screens that can stream content simultaneously.
Basic (1 screen, SD)

The company generates revenue primarily through its subscription fees, and it continues to experiment with features like mobile-only plans in some regions to increase affordability.

## Content Library:
