Netflix is a popular global streaming service that offers a wide variety of TV shows, movies, documentaries, and original content. It was founded in 1997 by Reed Hastings and Marc Randolph as a DVD rental service, but it pivoted to online streaming in 2007. Netflix quickly became a leader in digital entertainment and now operates in over 190 countries.

In addition to streaming content from other studios, Netflix has invested heavily in original productions, producing popular shows like Stranger Things, The Witcher, and The Crown, along with a growing library of films and documentaries. It operates on a subscription-based model, offering different plans for users to access content on-demand, with no ads.
